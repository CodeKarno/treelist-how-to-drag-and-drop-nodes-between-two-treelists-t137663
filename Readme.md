# TreeList - How to drag and drop nodes between two treelists


This example demonstrates how to drag and drop nodes between two treelists. To do so, each extension has its client-side <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxTreeListScriptsASPxClientTreeList_StartDragNodetopic">StartDragNode</a> and <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebASPxTreeListScriptsASPxClientTreeList_EndDragNodetopic">EndDragNode</a> events handled to:<br />
<p>- Add new drop targets for the node being dragged;<br />- Perform a callback to the server to update the state of both treelists.</p>
This logic is implemented inside the MyDragHelper.js file.<br /><br /><strong>See Also:</strong><br /><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E251">How to drag and drop nodes between two ASPxTreeList controls</a>
